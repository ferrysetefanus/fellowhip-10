### What is a DAG?
A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a visual representation of a workflow or a pipeline. In the context of data engineering, a DAG is used to represent and visualize the dependencies between tasks in a data pipeline.
Each node in the DAG represents a task, and the edges represent the dependencies between tasks. DAGs are particularly useful in workflow management systems like Apache Airflow, where they are used to define and schedule data processing tasks.

DAGs provide several advanced capabilities and concepts for managing data pipelines:

- Dependency Management: DAGs define the dependencies between tasks, indicating the order in which tasks should be executed. This ensures that tasks are executed only after their dependencies have been successfully completed.

- Parallelism and Concurrency: DAGs allow for parallel execution of tasks whenever possible. Tasks that have no dependencies or independent tasks can be executed concurrently, maximizing the utilization of computing resources and reducing the overall pipeline execution time.

- Retries and Error Handling: DAGs support retry mechanisms to handle task failures. If a task fails, the workflow management system can automatically retry the task a specified number of times or based on a configured schedule. Error handling strategies, such as sending notifications or executing recovery actions, can be defined within the DAG.

- Dynamic Task Generation: DAGs can dynamically generate tasks based on runtime conditions or parameters. This enables the creation of flexible and adaptable pipelines that can adjust their behavior based on the available data or external factors.

Example Use Case in Banking Industry:
In the banking industry, consider a use case where a financial institution needs to process daily transaction data from various sources, perform data transformations, and generate reports for different business units. A DAG can be used to define and schedule the tasks involved in this data processing pipeline.

Here's an example DAG for this use case:
```sh
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery import BigQueryOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.gcs import GCSToBigQueryOperator
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.sensors.gcs import GCSObjectExistenceSensor

default_args = {
    'owner': 'banking_team',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2023, 7, 1),
    'retries': 3,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

dag = DAG(
    'banking_data_pipeline',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval='0 0 * * *',  # Run daily at midnight
)

# Task 1: Check if new transaction file is available in GCS
file_sensor_task = GCSObjectExistenceSensor(
    task_id='file_sensor',
    bucket='your-gcs-bucket',
    object='path/to/transaction_file.csv',
    dag=dag
)

# Task 2: Extract and load transaction data into BigQuery
extract_load_task = GCSToBigQueryOperator(
    task_id='extract_load',
    bucket='your-gcs-bucket',
    source_objects=['path/to/transaction_file.csv'],
    destination_project_dataset_table='your_project.your_dataset.transaction_data',
    schema_fields=[...],  # Define the schema of the destination table
    write_disposition='WRITE_APPEND',  # Append data to the table
    dag=dag
)

# Task 3: Transform and aggregate transaction data in BigQuery
transform_task = BigQueryOperator(
    task_id='transform',
    sql='SELECT account_id, SUM(amount) as total_amount FROM your_project.your_dataset.transaction_data GROUP BY account_id',
    destination_dataset_table='your_project.your_dataset.aggregated_data',
    write_disposition='WRITE_TRUNCATE',  # Overwrite the destination table
    dag=dag
)

# Task 4: Generate reports from the aggregated data
generate_reports_task = ...

# Define task dependencies
file_sensor_task >> extract_load_task >> transform_task >> generate_reports_task

```

In the diagram, the DAG represents a banking data pipeline. Task 1 checks if a new transaction file is available in Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Task 2 extracts and loads the transaction data from GCS into BigQuery. Task 3 transforms and aggregates the transaction data within BigQuery. Task 4 represents the generation of reports from the aggregated data.

The DAG allows for the automation and scheduling of these tasks, ensuring that the pipeline is executed on a daily basis, starting from the specified start date. Task dependencies ensure that each task is executed in the correct order, enabling efficient and reliable data processing in the banking industry.

In a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), there are various components that work together to define and execute the workflow. Let's explore these components in detail:

- Operators: Operators represent the individual tasks within a DAG. Each operator performs a specific action, such as extracting data, transforming data, or loading data into a target system. There are different types of operators available in Airflow, such as PythonOperator, BashOperator, BigQueryOperator, and more.
Example Code for PythonOperator:

```sh
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def my_python_function():
    # Your Python code here
    pass

with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 7, 1), schedule_interval='0 0 * * *') as dag:
    task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='my_task',
        python_callable=my_python_function
    )

```

- Sensors: Sensors are specialized operators that monitor external systems or conditions. They wait for a specific condition to be met before proceeding to the next task in the DAG. For example, a FileSensor can wait for a file to appear in a directory before triggering the next task.
Example Code for FileSensor:

```sh
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.sensors.filesystem import FileSensor
from datetime import datetime

with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 7, 1), schedule_interval='0 0 * * *') as dag:
    task = FileSensor(
        task_id='my_sensor',
        filepath='/path/to/file',
        poke_interval=300  # Check every 5 minutes
    )

```

- Hooks: Hooks are a way to interact with external systems or services within operators. They provide a connection interface to systems like databases, APIs, and cloud services. Hooks are used to establish connections, retrieve data, and perform operations in these systems.
Example Code for BigQueryHook:

```sh
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.bigquery import BigQueryHook
from datetime import datetime

def my_function():
    bq_hook = BigQueryHook()
    # Use the hook to interact with BigQuery
    pass

with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 7, 1), schedule_interval='0 0 * * *') as dag:
    task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='my_task',
        python_callable=my_function
    )

```

- Variables: Variables are used to store and retrieve key-value pairs within Airflow. They can be used to store configurations, credentials, or any other dynamic values that can be accessed by tasks during the execution of a DAG.

Example Code for Setting Variables:

```sh
from airflow import DAG, settings
from datetime import datetime

with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 7, 1), schedule_interval='0 0 * * *') as dag:
    # Setting a variable
    settings.set_variable('my_variable', 'my_value')

```

Example Code for Retrieving Variables:

```sh
from airflow import DAG, settings
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def my_function():
    # Retrieving a variable
    my_variable = settings.get_variable('my_variable')
    pass

with DAG('my_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 7, 1), schedule_interval='0 0 * * *') as dag:
    task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='my_task',
        python_callable=my_function
    )

```
