What is an Orchestration Pipeline?
An orchestration pipeline is a sequence of interconnected steps that defines the flow and execution order of data processing tasks. It provides a framework for managing and automating the execution of complex data workflows.

An orchestration pipeline in the context of data engineering involves managing the end-to-end process of extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources to target systems, such as a Data Lake or a data warehouse. and coordinating the execution of tasks and workflows to ensure the smooth and efficient processing of data. Here are some advanced details about orchestration pipelines:

- Workflow Management: An orchestration pipeline enables the definition and management of complex workflows that involve multiple tasks and dependencies. It provides a centralized control system to schedule, monitor, and track the progress of each task in the workflow.

- Dependency Management: Tasks within an orchestration pipeline often have dependencies on each other. Dependencies define the order in which tasks need to be executed, ensuring that data is processed correctly. An orchestration tool, such as Apache Airflow or Google Cloud Composer, handles these dependencies and ensures tasks are executed in the correct sequence.

- Fault Tolerance and Error Handling: Orchestration pipelines incorporate fault tolerance and error handling mechanisms to handle failures and errors during task execution. These mechanisms include retries, error notifications, error logging, and automated recovery processes.

- Scalability and Parallel Execution: Orchestration tools allow for the parallel execution of tasks, enabling data processing tasks to be distributed across multiple resources for faster and efficient processing. This scalability feature is especially important when dealing with large volumes of data.

- Monitoring and Logging: Orchestration pipelines provide monitoring and logging capabilities to track the execution status and performance of tasks. They capture and store task-level logs, execution times, and other relevant metrics, enabling data engineers to identify bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and optimize workflows.

### Example Use Case in Banking Industry:
In the banking industry, consider a use case where a financial institution needs to ingest and process transaction data from various sources, perform data transformations, and load the transformed data into a Data Lake (Google Cloud Storage - GCS). The institution also wants to schedule and automate this data processing pipeline.

To achieve this, an orchestration pipeline can be set up using a combination of Apache Airflow and Google Cloud Composer.

The orchestration pipeline can include the following tasks:

- Task 1: Extracting transaction data from multiple sources, such as core banking systems, credit card transaction systems, and external data feeds.

- Task 2: Performing data transformations on the extracted data, including data cleansing, normalization, and enrichment. This may involve joining data from different sources, aggregating transaction information, or applying business rules.

- Task 3: Loading the transformed data into a Data Lake in Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This involves storing the transformed data in its raw form without predefined schemas, allowing for flexibility in analysis and exploration.

- Task 4: Applying data governance and security measures to ensure data privacy and compliance. This may involve encrypting sensitive data, implementing access controls, and monitoring data access.

        schedule_interval=None,
        start_date=datetime(2023, 7, 1)
    )

    extract_gcs_task = GCSToLocalFilesystemOperator(
        task_id='extract_gcs',
        bucket='your-gcs-bucket',
        object_name='path/to/file.csv',
        destination_path='/path/to/local/file.csv',
        dag=dag
    )

    extract_mysql_task = MySqlOperator(
        task_id='extract_mysql',
        sql='SELECT * FROM your_table',
        mysql_conn_id='your_mysql_connection',
        dag=dag
    )

    extract_gcs_task >> extract_mysql_task

    ```

- Task 2: Transform Data:

    - Task 2 focuses on transforming the extracted data to make it suitable for analysis and loading into the data warehouse.
    The transformation task is divided into subtasks for better modularity and reusability. In this example, Subtask 1 represents data transformation operations, such as data cleansing, filtering, and aggregations. Subtask 2 represents data enrichment operations, which can involve integrating additional data sources or performing complex calculations.

    ```sh
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    dag = DAG(

    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery import BigQueryOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    dag = DAG(
        'load_data',
        schedule_interval=None,
        start_date=datetime(2023, 7, 1)
    )

    load_bigquery_task = BigQueryOperator(
        task_id='load_bigquery',
        sql='SELECT * FROM your_transformed_data',
        destination_dataset_table='your_project.your_dataset.your_table',
        write_disposition='WRITE_TRUNCATE',  # or 'WRITE_APPEND' or 'WRITE_EMPTY'
        create_disposition='CREATE_IF_NEEDED',
        dag=dag
    )

    load_bigquery_task

    ```

- Task 4: Data Warehouse:
    - Task 4 represents additional data processing or analysis tasks performed within BigQuery.
    These tasks can include SQL queries, data aggregations, advanced analytics, or machine learning operations using BigQuery's powerful processing capabilities.

    ```sh
    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.providers.google.cloud.operators.bigquery import BigQueryOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    dag = DAG(
        'data_warehouse',
        schedule_interval=None,
        start_date=datetime(2023, 7, 1)
    )

    data_processing_task = BigQueryOperator(
        task_id='data_processing',
        sql='SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE condition',
        destination_dataset_table='your_project.your_dataset.your_processed_table',
        write_disposition='WRITE_TRUNCATE',  # or 'WRITE_APPEND' or 'WRITE_EMPTY'
        create_disposition='CREATE_IF_NEEDED',
        dag=dag
    )

    data_processing_task

    ```

The orchestration pipeline, managed by Apache Airflow running on Google Cloud Composer, handles the scheduling, dependency management, and monitoring of each task within the pipeline. It ensures that tasks are executed in the correct sequence and provides visibility into the pipeline's progress and status.

Overall, this orchestration pipeline enables the seamless extraction, transformation, loading, and analysis of data from various sources into BigQuery, facilitating data-driven decision-making in the banking industry.
