Setting up Airflow with Docker-Compose provides a scalable and portable solution for running Airflow in a containerized environment. Here are some advanced details and considerations:

- Docker-Compose YAML file: The Docker-Compose YAML file defines the services required for running Airflow, such as the web server, scheduler, and database. You can customize the YAML file based on your specific requirements, including volume mounts, environment variables, and network configurations.

- Airflow Configuration: You can configure Airflow-specific settings using environment variables in the Docker-Compose YAML file. This includes specifying the database backend (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL), authentication mechanisms, logging configurations, and other Airflow settings.

- Scaling Airflow Services: Docker-Compose allows you to scale Airflow services to handle increased workloads. For example, you can scale up the number of web server instances or scheduler instances to improve performance and handle higher task throughput.

- Data Persistence: It's important to ensure data persistence when running Airflow with Docker-Compose. You can achieve this by mounting host directories or using Docker volumes to store Airflow-related data, such as the database, DAGs, and logs. This ensures that your data is preserved even if the containers are restarted or recreated.

- Integration with External Systems: If your Airflow workflows require connections to external systems or services (e.g., databases, cloud providers, APIs), you can configure these connections in Airflow using environment variables or configuration files. This allows your Airflow tasks to interact with these systems seamlessly.

Example Use Case in Banking Industry:

In the banking industry, consider a use case where a financial institution needs to automate data ingestion and processing from various sources into a Data Lake (Google Cloud Storage) using Airflow. Here's an example of setting up Airflow with Docker-Compose for this use case:

Create a Docker-Compose YAML file (e.g., docker-compose.yaml) with the following services:

Airflow Web Server: Exposes the Airflow UI for managing and monitoring workflows.
Airflow Scheduler: Executes scheduled tasks and manages the workflow schedule.
PostgreSQL Database: Stores Airflow metadata, such as DAG definitions and task states.
Redis: Acts as a message broker for Airflow's internal messaging system (optional but recommended for distributed setups).
Configure Airflow environment variables in the YAML file:

Set the database connection details, such as the database host, port, name, username, and password.
Define other Airflow-specific environment variables, such as the executor type, authentication settings, and logging configurations.
Build and start the containers:

Run the following command in the terminal to build and start the Airflow containers:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start the Airflow services and create the necessary containers based on the configuration in the Docker-Compose YAML file.

- Access the Airflow UI:
Once the containers are running, you can access the Airflow UI by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080. From the Airflow UI, you can manage workflows, view task statuses, and monitor the execution of DAGs.

In the diagram, the Airflow services (web server, scheduler, and database) are running within separate containers on the Docker host. The web server provides the Airflow UI for managing workflows, while the scheduler handles the execution and scheduling of tasks. The PostgreSQL database stores Airflow metadata and manages the state of the workflows. The Docker host environment facilitates the containerization and execution of these services.

Setting up Airflow with Docker-Compose provides a scalable and portable environment for running Airflow, allowing the banking institution to automate their data ingestion and processing workflows into the Data Lake efficiently.

### Simple-Advance

Load Dockerfile
Load docker-compose.yml

In this example:

The Dockerfile extends the official Apache Airflow image and installs any additional dependencies required for your Airflow setup. You can customize it by adding any specific Python packages or libraries required for your DAGs and plugins.

The Dockerfile also copies your DAGs, plugins, and other files to the appropriate directories in the container. It includes an airflow.cfg file that allows you to customize Airflow's configuration.

The Docker Compose YAML file defines two services: airflow and postgres. The airflow service represents the Airflow web server, scheduler, and worker, while the postgres service represents the PostgreSQL database.

The volumes section in the Docker Compose file mounts the local directories containing your DAGs, plugins, requirements.txt file, and airflow.cfg file into the appropriate directories in the Airflow container.

The environment section in the Docker Compose file sets the required environment variables for Airflow, such as the executor type, the connection details for your PostgreSQL database, and enabling RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for Airflow's web UI.

The depends_on section in the Docker Compose file ensures that the airflow service waits for the postgres service to be up and running before starting.

The networks section in the Docker Compose file defines an airflow-network for the services to communicate with each other.

The volumes section in the Docker Compose file defines a volume named postgres-data to persist the data of the PostgreSQL database.

To use this setup:

Create a directory structure with the Dockerfile, Docker Compose YAML file, DAGs, plugins, requirements.txt file, and airflow.cfg file.

Replace <additional-dependencies>, <db-username>, <db-password>, <db-host>, <db-port>, and <db-name> placeholders in the Dockerfile and Docker Compose file with your specific values.

Place your DAGs inside the dags/ directory and plugins inside the plugins/ directory.

If you have any additional Python packages required, add them to the requirements.txt file.

Customize the airflow.cfg file to match your Airflow configuration needs.

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and Docker Compose file, and run the following command to start the Airflow services:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will build the Airflow container and start the services in detached mode.

You can access the Airflow UI by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080.

This advanced setup allows for greater flexibility and customization in configuring Airflow with Docker-Compose, including persistent PostgreSQL database storage, RBAC-enabled Airflow UI, and detailed control over the Airflow container's configuration.
